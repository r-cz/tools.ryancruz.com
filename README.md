# Developer Tools Hub

This repository houses the code for tools.ryancruz.com, a collection of useful developer tools and utilities. Built with React, Vite, and TailwindCSS, this site provides a set of handy tools for everyday development tasks.

## Available Tools

- **JWT Decoder**: Decode and verify JWT tokens, with a clean interface for examining headers and payloads
- **Mermaid Diagram Viewer**: Live preview for Mermaid diagrams with support for all diagram types

## Technology Stack

- **Runtime**: Bun
- **Framework**: React 18 with Vite
- **Routing**: React Router 6
- **Styling**: TailwindCSS
- **Deployment**: CloudFlare Pages
- **Icons**: Heroicons
- **Dark Mode**: System-aware with user preference persistence
- **Font**: Inter variable font

## Development

First, install dependencies using Bun:

```bash
bun install
```

To start the development server:

```bash
bun dev
```

To build for production:

```bash
bun run build
```

## Adding New Tools

1. Create a new component in `src/tools/`
2. Add the route in `App.jsx`
3. Add the tool to the `tools` array in the `ToolsList` component

Example:

```jsx
// src/tools/NewTool.jsx
function NewTool() {
  return (
    <div className="space-y-6">
      <h1 className="text-2xl font-bold">New Tool</h1>
      {/* Tool implementation */}
    </div>
  );
}

// In App.jsx, add to tools array:
const tools = [
  // ...existing tools
  {
    name: 'New Tool',
    description: 'What this tool does',
    path: '/new-tool',
    icon: 'ðŸ”§'
  }
];
```

## Performance Considerations

- Tools are lazy-loaded using React.lazy()
- Production builds are optimized with chunk splitting
- Images and assets are optimized during build
- Tailwind's JIT compiler ensures minimal CSS bundle size

## Deployment

The site is automatically deployed via CloudFlare Pages when changes are pushed to the main branch. The build process:

1. Installs dependencies using Bun
2. Builds the project with Vite
3. Deploys to CloudFlare's edge network

The deployment configuration is managed through CloudFlare, with DNS and hosting handled by CloudFlare Pages. Each commit to the main branch triggers an automatic build and deployment process.
